Avoid generating emails about failure to deliver emails\n\nImprove handling of delayed mail delivery\n\nIf a mail is delivered more than 60 seconds after it was put in the\noutbox, a warning is logged.  (Historically, such delays have been a\nsymptom of the \"sender\" failing to wake up the mail delivery process\nafter placing mail in the outbox; so the warning has been meaningful.)\n\nHowever, delayed delivery also happens when the mail server stops\naccepting connections or mails for a while.  Sending one mail to the\nsystem administrator(s) per warning (and thus per delayed mail) isn't\nvery helpful.  Instead, log a single warning indicating that some\nmail were delayed, including the total number of delayed mails, how\nlong the most delayed mail was delayed, and what mail that was.  This\nshould be enough information to figure out what's wrong (if anything.)\n",

This included errors\nlogged by the mail delivery service.  But errors logged by it are\ntypically about inability to deliver email in the first place, so it\nmakes little sense to send further emails about it.\n\nWhat's worse, attempting to send emails about mail delivery problems can\nlead to exponential amounts of emails being generated as long as mail\ndelivery is broken.\n\nWith these changes, a single email is sent to the system administrator(s)\nafter an (unrelated) email has been successfully delivered, if any errors\nor warnings have been logged, urging the system administrator(s) to check\nthe logs.  This email is also delivered directly rather than going\nthrough the normal outbox mechanism, thus avoiding treating this as any\nother email that in turn can trigger normal error handling.\n",
