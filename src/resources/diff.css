/* The coloring of diffs (deleted => red, inserted => green, et.c.)

   Basic line HTML:

     <tr class="line [type]">
       ...
       <td class="line old">
         [old code]
       </td>
       ...
       <td class="line new">
         [new code]
       </td>
       ...
     </tr>

   The [type] is one of the following:

     context    => a line that wasn't changed
     whitespace => line with only white-space changes
     replaced   => changed line where old and new version has little in common
     modified   => changed line with inter-line diff
     inserted   => line that only exists in new version ([old code] is empty)
     deleted    => line that only exists in old version ([new code] is empty)
